        Settled next to a river, the settlement of Doonatel is home to vampires lead by Knight Evatt.
        This settlement wasn't built by a river by accident, as it has a dark history, which is of great importance to the people of Doonatel and its success.
        </p>
        <p>
        The settlement itself looks mundane. With its gray rooftops, worn limestone walls and large cobwebs, Doonatel has a macabre atmosphere.
        The main attraction is the greenhouse, which was built 25 years ago and designed by giants.        
        </p>
        <p>
        Doonatel has an advancing economy, which is mainly supported by farming, cooking and animal training. But their biggest strengths are rare animal breeding and ancient wine brewing techniques.
        However, Doonatel lacks people skilled in jewelcrafting. Despite its strengths and weaknesses, Doonatel is most likely headed towards a flourishing future under the leadership of Knight Evatt. But this remains to be seen.
